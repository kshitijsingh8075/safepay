1. Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine
Objective: Assign dynamic risk scores to transactions in real time using machine learning, behavioral biometrics, and network analysis to detect anomalies and fraud patterns.

Technical Workflow Breakdown
A. Ensemble Machine Learning Models
The engine combines multiple models to balance accuracy, speed, and anomaly detection:

XGBoost/LightGBM (Supervised Learning):

Role: Analyze structured transaction features (amount, location, time).

Training: Uses labeled historical data (fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions).

Example: Predicts risk based on patterns like "high-value transactions at unusual times."

Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection):

Role: Identify outliers in transaction amounts or frequencies.

Mechanism: Randomly partitions data into "trees." Transactions requiring fewer splits to isolate are flagged as anomalies.

Example: A user who typically spends ₹500/day suddenly initiates a ₹1,00,000 transfer → flagged as outlier.

Neural Networks (Deep Learning):

Role: Process unstructured data (e.g., transaction notes like "urgent loan payment").

Architecture: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based data (e.g., QR codes).

B. Feature Engineering
Key features engineered for the models:

Temporal Features:

Time since last transaction (e.g., a user making 10 transactions in 5 minutes).

Rolling transaction frequency (e.g., average 3 transactions/day vs. sudden 20/day).

Geospatial Features:

Haversine Distance: Calculate distance between user’s current location and their usual transaction zone.

Formula:

Copy
a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cosφ1 * cosφ2 * sin²(Δλ/2)  
distance = 2R * atan2(√a, √(1−a))  
Example: A user usually transacts in Delhi but initiates a payment from Chennai → flagged.

Network Features:

Transaction Graph Analysis: Build a graph where nodes are accounts/devices, and edges represent transactions.

Degree Centrality: Accounts connected to many others (potential mule accounts).

Clustering Coefficient: Detect tightly-knit fraud rings (e.g., money laundering cycles).

C. Behavioral Biometrics
Track subtle user behavior to distinguish humans from bots:

Typing Speed:

Measure time between keystrokes during PIN entry.

Fraudsters using automated scripts often type faster (e.g., 100ms vs. 500ms for humans).

Device Tilt/Gyroscope Data:

Humans tilt phones naturally while typing; bots show no movement.

Touch Pressure:

Capacitive sensors detect pressure. Bots may simulate taps with uniform pressure.

User Profiling:

Build a 30-day baseline for each user (e.g., average transaction amount, typical recipients).

Flag deviations using Z-score:

Copy
Z = (Current Value - Mean) / Standard Deviation  
A Z-score > 3 indicates high anomaly (e.g., ₹50,000 vs. usual ₹500).

D. Device Fingerprinting
Identify devices to detect unauthorized access:

Hardware Parameters:

IMEI (unique device ID), MAC address, processor type.

Software Parameters:

Installed fonts, browser plugins, screen resolution.

Risk Rules:

New device + high-value transaction → block and trigger OTP.

VPN usage + foreign IP → flag for manual review.

E. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Map transaction networks to detect complex fraud patterns:

Graph Construction:

Nodes: Users, accounts, devices.

Edges: Transactions, shared IPs, linked phone numbers.

Fraud Detection:

Mule Accounts: Nodes with high in-degree (receiving funds from many unrelated accounts).

Cycle Detection: Transactions like A → B → C → A (common in money laundering).

Example Scenario
User Action: A user who usually sends ₹500/day initiates a ₹50,000 transfer to a new account.
Detection Steps:

Isolation Forest flags the amount as an outlier (99th percentile).

Device Fingerprinting shows the transaction is from a new phone (IMEI not in 30-day history).

GNN Analysis reveals the recipient account is linked to 10 other flagged accounts.

Action: System blocks the transaction and sends an SMS: "Suspicious activity detected. Confirm via OTP."

Challenges & Solutions
Data Imbalance:

Fraud cases are rare (e.g., 0.1% of transactions).

Solution: Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) to generate synthetic fraud samples.

Model Drift:

Fraud patterns evolve over time (e.g., new scam tactics).

Solution: Retrain models weekly using fresh data.

Scalability:

Processing millions of transactions in real time.

Solution: Deploy on AWS SageMaker with auto-scaling.
