Prompt: WhatsApp Scam Detection Feature (with Keyword Integration)
In the 'WhatsApp Scam' section of the app, build a smart system that allows users to report and detect fraudulent messages. Here‚Äôs how it should work:

üîß Core Functionality:
‚úÖ User Upload: The user uploads a screenshot of a suspected WhatsApp scam.

‚úçÔ∏è Text Input: Below the image, the user can describe the context in 2‚Äì3 lines (e.g., "This person asked for money claiming to be a relative").

üîç Text Extraction: The system uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract visible text from the uploaded image.

Recommended: Use Tesseract OCR (for local/server-side implementation) or Google Vision API (for cloud accuracy).

üß† AI Analysis: Combine the extracted OCR text and user-provided description, and send it to the OpenAI API for analysis using a prompt like:

‚ÄúYou are a fraud detection expert. Analyze this message and tell if it is a scam, phishing attempt, or a genuine message.‚Äù

üßæ Keyword Matching:

Internally, the system should compare the OCR and description text against a scam keyword database of around 1000 terms, which improves the accuracy of scam detection.

üõ°Ô∏è Scam Detection Output:
Based on AI + keyword matching:

üö® "Scam Likely" ‚Äì if high scam confidence or keyword match is strong.

‚ö†Ô∏è "Suspicious Message" ‚Äì if unclear or borderline case.

‚úÖ "Safe Message" ‚Äì if no scam patterns are found.

Each result should include:

A brief reason or explanation for the result

A confidence score (e.g., Scam Likely ‚Äì 92%)

Optional: Link to similar reported scams or ‚ÄúReport to Authority‚Äù button

üìö Scam Keywords Integration (Sample from Full 1000):
Here‚Äôs a glimpse of the keyword bank (full list can be stored in database or .json file for faster matching):

"last chance", "within 5 minutes", "your account will be closed", "urgent reply", "immediate action needed", "final warning", "or else", "do it now", "today only", "24 hours left"
‚ú® Note: The final database should contain synonyms, variations, and multilingual versions (e.g., Hindi-English mixed words like ‚Äúpaisa bhejo urgent‚Äù, ‚Äúbank band ho gaya‚Äù, ‚Äúaccount update karo‚Äù).

üß† Backend Note:
Combine OpenAI‚Äôs language understanding with your keyword-based risk score:

If AI says ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but keyword density is high ‚Üí mark as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù

If both AI and keywords agree ‚Üí give stronger confidence

Optionally use a machine learning classifier later based on labeled data.
