eplace the "History" section of the application/website with a real-time AI-powered Chat Support System that helps users prevent and respond to online financial frauds. This system will be powered using OpenAI's paid API, which I will provide when needed.

🔐 Purpose and Use Cases
The main goal is to build a Fraud Report Support Chatbot that offers educational and action-oriented guidance to users who may be victims of or are suspicious of fraudulent activities. The chatbot will serve as a 24x7 Helpdesk and act as the first point of contact in emergency or confusing situations.

🔧 Core Functionalities
Educational Support:

Teach users how to report UPI scams

Explain the purpose and usage of the 1930 national cyber helpline

Guide users on how to lodge an FIR both online and offline

Emergency Use Cases:

If a user types: “Mere account se paisa chala gaya” or “Money was deducted from my account”, the chatbot should immediately reply:

“Please call 1930 immediately and also contact your bank.”

General Query Resolution:

When users ask:

“Is this link safe?”

“I received a refund message—what should I do?”

“I think someone is trying to scam me.”

The chatbot should provide relevant, safe, and step-by-step guidance.

Language Support:

The chatbot should support Hindi, English, and at least two regional languages (such as Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.), making it accessible and understandable to a wider audience.

Conversational Flow:

The chatbot should use natural language processing to handle casual phrasing and common user queries.

Support both typed and voice input (optional/advanced stage).

User-Friendly Interface:

Include quick reply buttons like:

Report UPI Scam

Call 1930

Lodge FIR

Verify Link Safety

Option to escalate to a human support agent if needed.
