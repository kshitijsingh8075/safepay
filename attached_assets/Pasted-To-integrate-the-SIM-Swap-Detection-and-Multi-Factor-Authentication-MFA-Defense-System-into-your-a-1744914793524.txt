To integrate the SIM Swap Detection and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Defense System into your already-built application and add it to the menu, follow these steps. This will involve several key components: API integration, UI changes, backend updates, and proper testing for scalability and compliance.

ðŸ“² Integration Steps for the SIM Swap Detection & MFA Defense System
1. Integrate Telecom APIs for SIM Swap Detection
To detect SIM swaps, you need to connect your application with telecom APIs (e.g., Airtel, Jio, or Twilio) that provide real-time SIM swap data.

1.1. Set Up API Integration:
Obtain API Credentials from telecom providers (or an aggregator like Twilio) to access their SIM swap detection services.

Make sure you have API keys or OAuth credentials for authentication.

API Polling Service: Set up a backend service that polls these APIs every 5 minutes to check for SIM change events associated with user accounts.

API Call Example:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def check_sim_swap(user_phone_number):
    url = "https://api.telecom-provider.com/sim-swap"
    params = {"phone_number": user_phone_number}
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
Polling Scheduler: Use a cron job or a scheduling library (e.g., APScheduler in Python) to run the above function at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

You can also use Apache Kafka or Apache Flink for real-time data stream processing if your app requires high scalability.

1.2. Handle SIM Swap Alerts:
When the SIM swap is detected, trigger an alert for the system to start the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) process.

You may store these alerts in a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database to track SIM swaps and related transactions.

Example Flow:
Alerting: When a SIM swap event is detected, trigger a User Alert and initiate the MFA process to verify the user's identity.

python
Copy
Edit
def sim_swap_alert(user_id, sim_swap_detected):
    if sim_swap_detected:
        send_push_notification(user_id, "SIM Swap Detected. Please verify your identity via MFA.")
        initiate_mfa(user_id)
2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
The MFA process should include OTP verification and biometric verification to ensure that only the authorized user can access their account after a SIM swap is detected.

2.1. OTP Verification
Send OTP to Email or Authenticator App: Use email services (e.g., SendGrid or Amazon SES) to send an OTP to the userâ€™s registered email address. Alternatively, for better security, integrate with an Authenticator App like Google Authenticator.

Example of OTP generation and sending:

python
Copy
Edit
import random
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def generate_otp():
    otp = random.randint(100000, 999999)
    return otp

def send_otp_email(user_email, otp):
    subject = "OTP for SIM Swap Verification"
    body = f"Your OTP for verifying SIM swap is: {otp}"
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = "noreply@yourdomain.com"
    msg['To'] = user_email

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.yourdomain.com') as server:
        server.login("your_email@domain.com", "your_password")
        server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())
2.2. Biometric Verification
Integrating Biometric Authentication:

Use WebAuthn for web-based applications or native biometric authentication for mobile apps.

For mobile apps, integrate the Face ID or Fingerprint Scanner SDKs (e.g., Android Biometric API or Apple Face ID).

Example: For mobile apps, the user will be prompted for biometric verification after the OTP validation.

2.3. Integrate Geolocation-Based Verification
GPS Data Verification: Use the userâ€™s GPS data from their device during login attempts.

If a SIM change is detected, compare the userâ€™s current location (GPS data) with the registered location of the SIM card.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def check_geolocation(user_id, current_location):
    user_location = get_user_registered_location(user_id)  # This could be stored during registration or previous logins
    
    if current_location != user_location:
        trigger_additional_verification(user_id)
2.4. Combine MFA Steps:
Step 1: Send OTP to email or authenticator app.

Step 2: Prompt for biometric authentication (face ID, fingerprint, etc.).

Step 3: Verify geolocation and check for anomalies.

Step 4: If all checks pass, allow access.

3. Backend Integration and Database Updates
3.1. User Profile Updates
Add fields in the user database to track:

Last SIM number

Last known GPS location

Last known device fingerprint

Biometric data for verification (if applicable).

3.2. Database Schema:
User Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    last_sim_number VARCHAR(15),
    last_location VARCHAR(255),
    is_sim_swap_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
Transaction Table:

Store the history of the userâ€™s transactions, so when anomalies are detected (e.g., SIM swap and transaction from a new location), these can be flagged for review.

4. User Interface Changes
To provide seamless user experience, add an MFA menu option under Account Settings or Security Settings.

4.1. Adding MFA to Menu:
Modify the front-end code to include the new SIM Swap Protection and MFA settings in your app's settings menu.

Example UI update in HTML (for web apps):

html
Copy
Edit
<ul>
  <li><a href="/account-settings">Account Settings</a></li>
  <li><a href="/security-settings">Security Settings</a></li>
  <li><a href="/enable-mfa">Enable Multi-Factor Authentication</a></li> <!-- Add this option -->
</ul>
4.2. MFA Verification Page:
Create a page to handle the MFA process.

html
Copy
Edit
<form id="mfa-form">
  <label for="otp">Enter OTP:</label>
  <input type="text" id="otp" name="otp">
  
  <label for="biometric">Biometric Verification:</label>
  <input type="file" id="biometric" name="biometric">
  
  <button type="submit">Verify</button>
</form>
5. Testing & Deployment
5.1. Testing the System
Unit Testing: Test individual components (API calls, OTP generation, biometric integration, geolocation verification).

End-to-End Testing: Simulate real-life fraud scenarios, including SIM swaps and anomalous locations, to ensure the system responds appropriately.

Performance Testing: Ensure the system can handle a large number of users and API calls without latency issues, particularly when scaling to millions of users.

5.2. Deployment Considerations
Cloud Deployment: Host your application on a scalable cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud to handle high traffic and real-time data processing.

Load Balancing: Implement load balancing to ensure seamless handling of requests, particularly during high traffic periods.

6. Add to Menu in Your Application
To add the SIM Swap Detection and MFA Defense system to your application menu:

Backend: Update your backend to include routes for managing SIM swap detection and MFA processes.

Example route in Python (Flask):

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route("/security-settings")
def security_settings():
    # Logic to handle MFA settings
    return render_template("security_settings.html")
Frontend: Update the menu structure (as shown above) and integrate it with the backend to ensure users can enable MFA and view their SIM swap protection status.
