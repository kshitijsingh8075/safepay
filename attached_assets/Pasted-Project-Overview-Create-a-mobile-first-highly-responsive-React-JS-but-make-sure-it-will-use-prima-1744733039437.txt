Screen Flow (Based on Images)Sign Up/Login → OTP → PIN → HomeHome:Scan & Pay (QR → Amount → Success)UPI Risk Check (input → result)Report Scam (form → submit)Voice Scam Detection (record → result)WhatsApp/SMS Screenshot (upload → result)History (list)Account (profile/settings)Footer navigation always visible8. Mock Data and StateUse React state/hooks for all flowsMock data for risk %, scam alerts, history, etc.No backend/API calls; all data is local9. Accessibility and ResponsivenessAll touch targets ≥48x48pxUse ScrollView for long forms/listsResponsive layouts using flex and DimensionsTest on multiple device sizes in Expo Go10. Summary for Replit AIBuild a mobile-first React Native (Expo) frontend for a UPI payment and scam detection app, using the Figma-style UI shown in the provided images. The design must be clean, minimal, and modern, with rounded elements, lots of white space, and #5164BF as the primary color. All screens and components should match the visual style and flow of the images, with large, rounded buttons and inputs, circular progress bars, and clear, accessible layouts. Use mock data and state for all flows, with no backend integration. The bottom tab bar should always be visible, with icons and labels for Home, Heatmap, Report, History, and Account. All screens must be optimized for mobile, with smooth navigation and clear feedback.
