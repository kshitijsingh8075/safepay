Python audio filters (e.g., noisereduce, librosa, or WebRTC VAD)

NLP & Keyword Detection:

BERT via Hugging Face Transformers

Regex-based keyword spotting

spaCy, nltk, or transformers for intent detection

Sentiment Analysis:

üìà Feature Breakdown (with implementation modules)
üîÅ Module 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
Step-by-step:
Capture audio from ongoing or recorded voice calls.

Apply noise reduction filters:

python
Copy
Edit
import noisereduce as nr
reduced_audio = nr.reduce_noise(y=original_audio, sr=sample_rate)
Convert voice to text using APIs:

python
Copy
Edit
import speech_recognition as sr
r = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.AudioFile("call_audio.wav") as source:
    audio = r.record(source)
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
Add language detection:

python
Copy
Edit
from langdetect import detect
detected_lang = detect(text)
Output:
Transcribed text

Detected language

Cleaned audio (optional)

üß† Module 2: NLP Keyword & Intent Detection
2A. Regex-Based Keyword Spotting
python
Copy
Edit
import re

scam_keywords = [
    "account blocked", "suspicious transaction", "UPI PIN", "RBI verification", 
    "click this link", "refund issued", "scan QR code", "court summon", 
    "OTP required", "pay ‚Çπ10", "cashback offer", "Covid compensation", 
    "remote access", "insurance update", "Microsoft call", "Apple security"
]

pattern = re.compile("|".join(scam_keywords), flags=re.IGNORECASE)

def detect_keywords(text):
    return pattern.findall(text)
2B. BERT-Based Intent Detection
Train or fine-tune a BERT model on intent categories such as:

Sensitive Info Request

Urgency Creation

Government Threat

Loan Scam

Reward Scam

Malicious Tech Support

Use Hugging Face Transformers:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="your-fine-tuned-bert")
intent = classifier(text)
2C. Sentiment & Emotion Analysis
Detect stress, manipulation, or urgency:

python
Copy
Edit
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
Output:
Matched keywords

Scam intent classification

Sentiment score (e.g., high negativity & urgency)

‚òéÔ∏è Module 3: Caller Reputation Database
3A. Integration Options:
Use Truecaller API (needs approval and number verification)

Build a custom reputation DB using:

Firebase / MongoDB

Community reporting via the app

3B. Risk Scoring Logic:
python
Copy
Edit
def compute_risk_score(num_reports, avg_call_duration, matched_keywords):
    score = 0
    if num_reports > 3:
        score += 40
    if avg_call_duration < 60:
        score += 20
    if len(matched_keywords) > 3:
        score += 30
    return min(score, 100)
Fields to store in DB:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "phone_number": "+919876543210",
  "reports": 5,
  "last_reported": "2025-04-15",
  "average_duration": 45,
  "intent_match": ["Sensitive Info Request"],
  "risk_score": 85
}
Output:
Caller risk score (0‚Äì100)

Flag for "Reported Scammer" or "Suspicious"

‚ö†Ô∏è Module 4: Real-Time Alert System
4A. Notification/Warning System
Based on risk score & keywords:

python
Copy
Edit
if score > 70:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Scam suspected. DO NOT share OTP or PIN.")
4B. Integration with Telephony APIs (Optional)
Use Twilio‚Äôs programmable voice:

python
Copy
Edit
from twilio.rest import Client
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
call = client.calls.create(
    twiml='<Response><Say>Warning: Scam detected.</Say></Response>',
    to="+919876543210",
    from_="+1234567890"
)
4C. In-App Popup for Banking Apps:
javascript
Copy
Edit
// JS pseudo-code
if (scamRiskScore > 70) {
    alert("‚ö†Ô∏è Fraud Risk: This number is associated with scams. End the call immediately.");
}
Output:
Real-time visual/audio warning

Optional auto-call disconnect

Logging system for audits

üìÅ Module 5: Logging and Reporting
Store all flagged incidents in logs:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-17T13:24:00Z",
  "caller": "+911234567890",
  "transcript": "Your account is blocked. Share OTP.",
  "detected_keywords": ["account blocked", "OTP"],
  "risk_score": 85,
  "action_taken": "Warning shown"
}
Build a dashboard (optional) to show:

Top reported scam numbers

Date-wise scam attempts

Success vs. block rate

üåê Final Flow Diagram (Modular Description)
üìû Incoming call triggers audio capture.

üîä Audio pre-processed ‚Üí noise filtered.

üìù Speech-to-text API converts to text.

üß† Text fed into NLP pipeline:

Keyword Match

Intent Classifier

Sentiment Analyzer

‚òéÔ∏è Caller number checked in DB.

üìä Risk score calculated.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning triggered if score > threshold.

üîÅ Logs updated for regulatory/reporting needs.

‚úÖ Example Scenario
Scam Call:

"This is the RBI. Your account has been compromised. Share your OTP now to avoid blockage."

What happens?

Speech-to-text converts it to text.

NLP detects:

Keywords: "RBI", "compromised", "OTP"

Intent: "Sensitive Info Request"

Sentiment: Urgency

Caller Reputation score = 90 (reported 5 times).

‚ö†Ô∏è App alerts user:
‚Äúüö® RBI Scam Detected! Do NOT share OTP. End the call now.‚Äù

üß© Bonus Features for Later
Multilingual support using Whisper/Google with automatic language switch.

Voice biometric fraud detection (scammer voiceprint matching).

Visual call transcript with highlights for high-risk words.

User feedback button to report missed scams or false positives.

üöß Challenges and Solutions

Challenge	Mitigation
Accents, dialects	Use fine-tuned regional ASR datasets
Real-time latency	Edge processing + fast model pipelines (Whisper, BERT-small)
False positives	Maintain whitelist of known banks/helplines
Lack of data for training	Use public scam voice datasets, simulate calls for training BERT
Telecom API access	Partner with telecom operators or banking apps
üß™ Testing & Debugging
Create a test call simulator on Replit using audio clips.

Run through pipeline and log performance:

Detection accuracy

Latency (target: <2 seconds)

Add unit tests for:

Keyword regex matches

Risk score logic

DB reputation lookups

üìé Final Instructions
Create a scam_detection.py file in your Replit app.

Divide your code into functions or classes:

convert_speech_to_text()

detect_keywords(text)

classify_intent(text)

calculate_risk_score()

check_caller_reputation()

trigger_alert()

Deploy and test with local files, then move to real-time streams using Twilio/Mic input.
